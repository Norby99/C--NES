# CSharp-NES
NES emulator written in C#

This project is heavily inspired by [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9).
The main goal of the project is to learn more about emulation and gain a better
understanding of low-level architectures. I'll follow javidx9's tutorial
(which is written in C++) and attempt to replicate it in C#.
Note that this project may never be finished, as I may lose interest in the future.
